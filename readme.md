# Bison and Flex to parse NEC2 syntax 

I would like to create a Pre-Processor for NEC2 syntax - this has been done already using 4nec2, but this only works on Windows. I would like a Mac/Linux command line version.

## SYNTAX SY Card 

4nec2 uses a SYNTAX of 

    SY VARIABLE = VALUE    Comment 

Whilst this seems simple so for height we often have 

    SY Z = 10.21    Max Height 

We can also have 

    SY Wire = #14
